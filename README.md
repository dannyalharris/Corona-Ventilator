In this project, a ASP.NET Web Application (WebApp) was made to visualize the real time graph based on the data that it gets from ESP32 microcontroller. There are three types of communication protocol that we can use namely httpclient, MySQL and MQTT protocols. Based on our testing, we found that the easiest way to obtain the data from ESP32 and save them into the database of the WebAPP is through MQTT protocol. However, for initial phase of this project, we just generate random MQTT JSON string message by using the MQTTBox and publish them to the WebApp through a public broker. For the development of WebApp and ESP32, we used Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and Arduino IDE. All files are located and can be found here in this project.


Background: The amount of software we use on different systems is constantly growing. Often, we would like to use a software on different systems, but this is for example only for Windows or only for Android. Thus, the manufacturer loses potential customers. The trend is towards applications that are suitable for multiple platforms. Here, a web browser is a universal visualization medium for making content usable on all devices and platforms. 

Task: The goal of this project is to examine the current server-side web app development frameworks. The aim is to identify systems whose server backend can be completely programmed by the user. Aspects such as costs, required system specifications, number of clients, training time, programming languages, responsiveness of the WebApp frontend, etc. are to be demonstrated. After theoretical evaluation a simple WebApp will be developed and presented in a demo application.  

The work includes the following goals and results:  

1. Research the state of the art WebApp frameworks 
2. Theoretical selection and evaluation 
3. Integration into a selected framework and the necessary programming languages 
4. Development of a demo application 
5. Documentation of the familiarization, development environment and handling of the framework and submission of all sources and documents used 
6. Presentation 
7. Extension as a research and development project possible.
